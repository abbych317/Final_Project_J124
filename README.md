## My Data Analysis Process

**Step 1**<br>
First, I chose which CSV I wanted to work with. The California Wildfires data looked the most cleaned up to me, which was supported by it's high "Usability" rating on Kaggle. An "easy" CSV to work with seemed like a good idea to me because it meant I could spend time actually looking into the data instead of constantly trying to clean it up or decipher its columns etc.
<br> After downloading the CSV, I imported it into Google Sheets. It looked like this:<br>

**Step 2**<br>
Since I knew I wanted to focus my analysis on how different Califronia counties have been impacted by wildfires, I chose for my first question to be:
> What were the top 10 counties with the highest average number of acres burned from 2013-2020?

**Step 3**<br>
I decided to create a pivot table looking at counties and their average acreage burned.

**Step 4**<br>
Next, I copied and pasted the pivot table data into a separate sheet.

**Step 5**<br>
The next thing to do was to sort the B column from Z-->A so that the highest values are shown towards the top.

Now I know what 10 counties saw the most burnt acreage from 2013-2020.<br>
I followed this process to answer the rest of my questions, simply changing the "Values" input for each question.
