## My Data Analysis Process

**Step 1**<br>
First, I chose which CSV I wanted to work with. The California Wildfires data looked the most cleaned up to me, which was supported by it's high "Usability" rating on Kaggle. An "easy" CSV to work with seemed like a good idea to me because it meant I could spend time actually looking into the data instead of constantly trying to clean it up or decipher its columns etc.
<br> After downloading the CSV, I imported it into Google Sheets. It looked like this:<br>

**Step 2**<br>
Since I knew I wanted to focus my analysis on how different Califronia counties have been impacted by wildfires, I chose for my first question to be:
> What were the top 10 counties with the highest average number of acres burned from 2013-2020?

**Step 3**<br>
I decided to create a pivot table looking at counties and their average acreage burned.

**Step 4**<br>
Next, I copied and pasted the pivot table data into a separate sheet.

**Step 5**<br>
The next thing to do was to sort the B column from Z-->A so that the highest values are shown towards the top.

Now I know what 10 counties saw the most burnt acreage from 2013-2020.<br>
I followed this process to answer the rest of my questions, simply changing the "Values" input for each question.

# **Story Pitch**
When looking at the counties that showed up the most in my data analysis, this is the breakdown by location:

Northern California - Butte, Mendocino, Shasta, Sonoma, Napa, Trinity, and Lake.<br>
Central California - n/a<br>
Southern California - Ventura, Los Angeles, and Santa Barbara.

My angle would be to investigate what makes fires so destructive. I would like to examine why Northern California is so heavily impacted compared to SoCal. This is where I would want more in-detail data about the infrastructure of the counties (maybe older counties result in more destroyed structures), as well as how the fire departments function (maybe SoCal has more funding/resources and can respond more quickly to wildfires and therefore prevent more damage).

I would contact Butte County Fire Department **Fire Chief John Messina** to ask about how high acreage damage has affected the community, and would also ask what the county does in terms of fire prevention. I would also contact Ventura County **Fire Marshal Massoud Araghi**. He is also involved in the Fire Prevention Bureau, so he could be a good source with insight on what the county could do better to prevent so much destruction. **Fire Chief/Director Thom Porter** on the Executive Staff of the California Dept. of Forestry and Fire Protection might have a clear perspective on how California as a state has been dealing with the increase of wildfires over the past few years.

Data on the 20 largest California wildfires would be helpful to trace if the same counties have had a long history of more damaging wildfires. CAL FIRE also publishes yearly reports that would help trace statistics from the past few years.
